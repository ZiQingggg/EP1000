        <h2><b>Website Development</b></h2>
        <p>For my first website we were told to watch a video by Jake Wright explaining how to make a basic webpage and based on what I learned from the video as you can see below in the image although it looks very simple I actually had a pretty hard time following along since it was first my time creating a website so along the way I think Mr Rodney sort of knew the whole class were having a hard time starting out so he gave us a starting point by explaining and showing us how to properly start a html doc and intoducing some shortcut tools and also at the same time told us to start slow and learn from basics first which after a few attempts and multiple times of rewatching Jake Wright's videos and copying and pasting of w3 schools I finally created my website.</p>
        <a href="web_dev01.jpg"></a><img src="images/projects/web_dev01.jpg" width="400px" /></a>
        <a href="web_dev02.jpg"></a><img src="images/projects/web_dev02.jpg" width="400px" /></a>
        <p>After a few days because I got more interested I then decided to develop it some more by changing the arrangement of the navigations and choosing a better color scheme and during the course of journey in my creation of this website I had to use w3 schools many times and search through youtube videos as I had never learnt coding before so for one example the organisation of my website It actually took me a long time to figure out how to delete empty spacings and white spacings to give it a cleancut look so how I figured was through a video where they included this solution code other than that I also added a background image in the back to make my website look nicer created a new container so I can separate my contents and footer into one section and header and tabs into a different Section and then after then I went into Github and created a new repository and loaded my files in to it.</p>

        <h2><b>Computer Aided Design GIMP</b></h2>
        <p>In this lesson I was tasked to mix a mixture of two images using GIMP and because I am a student came from MAD School I found it quite fun as it reminded me of using photoshop although the tools are a little different so basically for this task I started out by dragging and dropping he image into the file and then used the free transform tool to outline the cat and subsequently deleting the original background and added a new background in the back and save them as jpeg and png</p>

        <h2><b>Computer Aided Design Inkscape</b></h2>
        <p>In this lesson we were tasked to create a vector image by using a software called Inkscape so for this tasked how I did it was by dragging and dropping the image into the software and next I had to use the path tool and fill and stroke to generate out shapes by using the pent tool to drag the curve to the specfic curvature and continously until you end it and click on fill path to genrate the shape and after multiple times of doing the same thing again it will then be completed</p>

        <h2><b>Computer Aided Design Fusion 360</b></h2>
        <p>In this lesson we were tasked to create 7 models which included, a lego brick, a keychain, a clock shape, a cup, a staircase boxes, a hex nut, a wrench and a Knight's chess piece</p>
        <p>So for each of them I started out with a top down view and sketch them out in fusion 360 and used tools the line tool, dimension tool and etc to draw out the specific shape and subsequently I then use the extrusion tool and the revovle tool to generate the shape out.</p>
        <p>But if you want to go into a more detailed explanation you can read more below.</p>



        <h3><b>Lego Brick</b></h3>
        <p>So basically for this Lego Brick I started by creating a new sketch and used tools like the rectangle tool and circle to generate out the shape and specific size after that I then extruded out the first circle and subsequently I then used the rectanglular pattern tool under patterns in the create tab to easily create out the rest of the circle extrusions.</p>
        <p>After doing the top part I then when to the bottom of the cube and shelled it and used circle tool and offset tool to create the sketch for the bottom part. Next I clicked on finish sketch and selected the bottom surface of the circles to extrude out an finally I then used the rectanglular pattern tool under patterns in the create tab again to make another 2 more circle extrusions.</p>

        <h3><b>A Whistle Ring(Individual Assignment)</b></h3>
        <p>The Whistle Ring it is a safety defense whistle ring meant for children and women of all ages. This whistle ring idea came to me from my friend who had dealt with an bad experience as a child so thus I decided to create this product and at the same time also felt that 3D printing would be a better way to create this object .How I created this product was first of starting by generating out a basic sketch first</p>
        <p>-After that I went to the internet to scour out how to create a whistle first, which I then came upon a website where it contained instructables(https://www.instructables.com/3D-Printing-Whistle/) on how to create a whistle so then I decided to it use it as reference to help me create my whistle part of the ring and even though they were using a different software I then decided to tweak it a bit for my own version of a normal whistle to helping me combine with the ring part.</p>
        <a href="fusion360_whistle_assignment00.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/fusion360_whistle_assignment00.jpg" width="400px" /></a>
       
        <p>-So essentially first I started out by generating the basic outline of it using the rectangle tool and the circle tool</p>
        <p>-Subsequently I then click on finish sketch and extrude out the base first</p>
        <a href="fusion360_whistle_assignment.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/fusion360_whistle_assignment.jpg" width="400px" /></a>
        <a href="fusion360_whistle_assignment2.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/fusion360_whistle_assignment2.jpg" width="400px" /></a>


        <p>-Next create a new sketch on the top surface again and used line tool and offset tool to create the rim of the whistle and made it will be 2mm in thickness and that there is angled part near the whistle hole.</p>
        <p>-Next I then clicked on finish sketch and extruded out the rim making sure it was offset by 2mm, operation was changed to join and extruded out as 10mm</p>
        <a href="fusion360_whistle_assignment3.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/fusion360_whistle_assignment3.jpg" width="400px" /></a>
        <a href="fusion360_whistle_assignment4.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/fusion360_whistle_assignment4.jpg" width="400px" /></a>


        <p>-Next I then click on the base sketch and extruded a top surface and made sure to offset it by 12 mm, operation was changed to join and extruded out as 2mm to close up the whistle </p>
        <a href="fusion360_whistle_assignment5.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/fusion360_whistle_assignment5.jpg" width="400px" /></a>
       
        <p>-Subsequently I then went to measure the diameter of my ring finger so it will fit perfectly</p>
        <a href="fusion360_whistle_assignment6.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/fusion360_whistle_assignment6.jpg" width="400px" /></a>

        <p>-Then next I went back to fusion 360 and create a new sketch </p>
        <p>-Next I used circle tool and offset tool to create the outline for the ring</p>
        <a href="fusion360_whistle_assignment7.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/fusion360_whistle_assignment7.jpg" width="400px" /></a>

        <p>-After that I then click on finish sketch and extruded out the ring making sure it was offsetted and extruded out as 8mm.</p>
        <a href="fusion360_whistle_assignment8.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/fusion360_whistle_assignment8.jpg" width="400px" /></a>
        
        <p>-Next I then went in the create tab I selected the sphere, clicked on the top surface so I can create the sphere in the center of the whistle.</p>
        <a href="fusion360_whistle_assignment9.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/fusion360_whistle_assignment9.jpg" width="400px" /></a>

        <p>-After that I went to the side view and made sure the ball is connected to the whistle by 0.2mm so that after 3d printing it out I can just use a sharp object to break the ball of in the whistle I won't need to complicate myself.</p>
        <a href="fusion360_whistle_assignment10.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/fusion360_whistle_assignment10.jpg" width="400px" /></a>
        
        <p>-Next I then Select the whistle body and sphere body under modify I click on combine to merge them into one object.</p>
        <a href="fusion360_whistle_assignment11.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/fusion360_whistle_assignment11.jpg" width="400px" /></a>

        <p>-After that I selected the edges of the whistle internally and eternally and fillet them making sure the corner type is in rolling ball and tangent was at a 0.5mm so as to smoothen it out. </p>
        <a href="fusion360_whistle_assignment12.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/fusion360_whistle_assignment12.jpg" width="400px" /></a>
        <a href="fusion360_whistle_assignment13.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/fusion360_whistle_assignment13.jpg" width="400px" /></a>

        <p>-Next I also fillet the internal edges of the ring making sure the corner type is in rolling ball and tangent was at a 0.3mm </p>
        <a href="fusion360_whistle_assignment14.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/fusion360_whistle_assignment14.jpg" width="400px" /></a>

        <p>-As for the external edges of the ring I decided to chamfer them at 0.5mm to give it a more slick look.</p>
        <a href="fusion360_whistle_assignment15.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/fusion360_whistle_assignment15.jpg" width="400px" /></a>

        <p>-Next for more decoration I then create a new sketch on the top surface </p>
        <p>-Used a line tool and create out a crown outline</p>
        <a href="fusion360_whistle_assignment16.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/fusion360_whistle_assignment16.jpg" width="400px" /></a>


        <p>-After that I then click on finish sketch and started extruding inwards and making sure it was only at 0.2mm.</p>
        <p>-Next I then did it again for the other side.</p>
        <a href="fusion360_whistle_assignment16.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/fusion360_whistle_assignment16.jpg" width="400px" /></a>

        <h3><b>Le Music Box(Individual Assignment)</b></h3>


        <p>Here is my How To tutorial on creating an Adventure Time themed music box so basically for this I had to looked at notes/presentation the cher gave me while looking through some youtube videos similar to this started to try to understand what was going on .</p>
        <p>-Step 1 I first clicked on modify and clicked on change parameters to change my parameters which can be seen below</p>
        <a href="musicbox_assign01.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/musicbox_assign01.jpg" width="150px" /></a>
        <a href="musicbox_assign02.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/musicbox_assign02.jpg" width="750px" /></a>


        <p>-Step 2 I will be creating my back and front surface of my music box</p>
        <p>-So firstly I started by creating a new sketch to create a sketch for both the front and back surface by inserting my parameters to aid me in creating the length and width of the rectangle first .</p>
        <p>-Next I then also started creating the tabs for the front and back surface of my music box with the same method as above and also decided to use some math within the demand like so below while at same time creating space for the lid to land on later.</p>
        <a href="musicbox_assign03.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/musicbox_assign03.jpg" width="300px" /></a>
        <a href="musicbox_assign04.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/musicbox_assign04.jpg" width="300px" /></a>
        
        <p>-Next I then used line tool, fit point spline tool, 2 point circle tool and eclipse tool to aid my design for the back part of the box.</p>
        <a href="musicbox_assign07.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/musicbox_assign07.jpg" width="400px" /></a>
        <a href="musicbox_assign08.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/musicbox_assign08.jpg" width="400px" /></a>

        <p>-Next I then started to extrude out the back piece and front piece while remembering to offset the front piece (decided not to extrude graphic inwards because I had a few problems exporting the graphic with the back surface together as a svg so decided to separately export them as sketch later on.</p>
        <a href="musicbox_assign09.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/musicbox_assign09.jpg" width="400px" /></a>
        <a href="musicbox_assign10.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/musicbox_assign10.jpg" width="400px" /></a>

        <p>-Step 3 I will be creating my left and right surface of my music box</p>
        <p>-For this step it is basically the same as above whereby I started by creating a new sketch on the x-axis to create a sketch for both the left and right surface by inserting my parameters to aid me in creating the length and width of the rectangle first . </p>
        <p>-Next I then also started creating the tabs for the left and right surface of my music box with the same method as above. </p>
        <p>-Next I measured the music device of its height and width so I can create hole's size and height and width while taking into consideration of the bottom surface of the 3mm ply wood which is concluded to be around 20mm by 10mm and a hole size of 8mm which is then included into the side sketch.</p>
        <a href="musicbox_assign11.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/musicbox_assign11.jpg" width="400px" /></a>
        <a href="musicbox_assign12.jpeg"></a><img src="images/assignments/musicbox_assign12.jpeg" width="400px" /></a>

        <p>-Next I then started to extrude out only the left side of the musicbox(to help me gauge for the lid's height and thickness so I can create a hole for it to fit through)(will be coming back to edit sketch extrude again) </p>
        <a href="musicbox_assign13.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/musicbox_assign13.jpg" width="400px" /></a>


        <p>-Step 4 I will be creating my lid surface of my music box(for this step you will have to take into account of you need the lid to close completely so when extruding you have to extrude the lid leaving 3mm of space at the back, left and right side )(for this lid because I wanted it to close without it bouncing up</p>
        <p>-So firstly I started by creating a new component ,selected the top surface to create a new sketch and then started out by creating the length and width of a rectangle using my parameters</p>
        <p>-After that I then offseted by 3mm to create a rectangle within</p>
        <a href="musicbox_assign14.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/musicbox_assign14.jpg" width="400px" /></a>

        <p>-Next I then start to create the mechanism meant for the lid to open and close without falling through</p>
        <a href="musicbox_assign15.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/musicbox_assign15.jpg" width="400px" /></a>

        <p>-After that I then used the circle tool to create a space for our fingers to open and close the lid</p>
        <p>-Next I then start to extrude out the lid all while making sure it is offsetted to about 47mm </p>
        <a href="musicbox_assign16.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/musicbox_assign16.jpg" width="400px" /></a>
        <a href="musicbox_assign17.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/musicbox_assign17.jpg" width="400px" /></a>

        <p>-Step 5 returning back to the left and right surface of the music box</p>
        <p>-After creating the extrusion of the lid we can go back to sides so that we can create a hole for it </p>
        <p>-so for this I basically started by selecting the side sketch and edited the sketch whereby I used the lid model's extrusion as a measurement and created a new circle for the hole based on it </p>
        <a href="musicbox_assign18.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/musicbox_assign18.jpg" width="400px" /></a>

        <p>-After that another circle was created using the one point circle tool which the dimension can be seen below </p>
        <a href="musicbox_assign19.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/musicbox_assign19.jpg" width="400px" /></a>
        <a href="musicbox_assign20.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/musicbox_assign20.jpg" width="400px" /></a>

        <p>-Next I then started to extrude out the left and right surface of the music box again all while remembering to deselect the hole meant for the music device handle and offsetting the right side to be about 107mm . </p>
        <a href="musicbox_assign21.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/musicbox_assign21.jpg" width="400px" /></a>

        <p>-Step 6 creating the bottom surface of the music box</p>
        <p>-So for this step is basically the same as the first step whereby I started creating a new sketch on the top surface by inserting my parameters to aid me in creating the length and width of the rectangle first .</p>
        <p>-Next I then also started creating the tabs with the same method as step 2 by using some math within the demand like so below.</p>
        <a href="musicbox_assign22.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/musicbox_assign22.jpg" width="400px" /></a>

        <p>-And then finally extruding it out</p>
        <a href="musicbox_assign23.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/musicbox_assign23.jpg" width="400px" /></a>

        <iframe src="https://gmail2479786.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH35dfcQT936092f0e43eea427d6361ce368?mode=embed" width="640" height="480" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>

        <p>-Step 7 preparing for lasercutting</p>
        <p>-basically for this part I had to export my models as a svg file so I can prepare them for lasercutting while at the same time adding designs</p>
        <p>-so firstly I started by selecting my front surface and press the letter p on my keyboard to project out sketch with the projection link on</p>
        <a href="musicbox_assign24.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/musicbox_assign24.jpg" width="400px" /></a>


        <p>-Next I then went to ulities and used the shaper origin while changing the input type to Entire Sketch and clicked on the projected sketch which I had created and saved it as a svg.</p>
        <p>-Next you will then have to repeat this for all sides of the music box</p>
        <a href="musicbox_assign25.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/musicbox_assign25.jpg" width="400px" /></a>

        <p>-Step 8 creating graphics for the music box</p>
        <p>-After importing all svgs file into inkscape I then searched for some images online that I liked and included them within my design </p>
        <a href="musicbox_assign26.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/musicbox_assign26.jpg" width="400px" /></a>



        <p>-Next I then started to trace them using the pen tool and edit paths by notes to adjust the line shape while at the same time making sure its color is green and because my line art has different line widths I had to export them as a png (raster) </p>
        <a href="musicbox_assign27.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/musicbox_assign27.jpg" width="400px" /></a>

        <p>-so because my design its a raster for the design I had to save them individually and adjust them later on when laser cutting</p>
        <a href="musicbox_assign28.jpg"></a><img src="images/assignments/musicbox_assign28.jpg" width="400px" /></a>


        <p>-Step 9 lasercutting time</p>
        <p>-For this part I basically went into fablab turned on filtration unit, laser cutter and computer(was using Epilog Pro) </p>
        <p>-After that I inserted my designs into corel draw making sure my cuts are in red with a hairline width and dragged in my already green colored designs and fitted in to the appropiate cuts of the music box and then finally clicked on print </p>
        <p>-Next I then inserted the speed,power and frequency based on this paper provided in fablab into the laser cutting engraving and vector settings. </p>
        <a href="musicbox_assign29.jpeg"></a><img src="images/assignments/musicbox_assign29.jpeg" width="400px" /></a>

        <p>-Next I then went to the lasercutter clicked on my and selected print </p>
        <a href="musicbox_assign30.jpeg"></a><img src="images/assignments/musicbox_assign30.jpeg" width="400px" /></a>

        <p>-Here is a live action video of the lasercutting happening</p>

        <p>-Here are the lasercutted out pieces </p>
        <a href="musicbox_assign32.jpeg"></a><img src="images/assignments/musicbox_assign32.jpeg" width="400px" /></a>

        <p>-Finally here is the final outcome </p>

        <h2><b>A Countdown timer(Assignment)</b></h2>
        <p>For this assignment we were tasked to program a countdown timer which I had a really hard time understanding because of the technical terms I then slowly started to realise how to do it whereby we had to reference from this website to input them into the code to get the numbers we want on the countdown timer</p>

        <h2><b>Introduction to programming(Assignment)</b></h2>
        <p>For this assignment we were tasked to control lighting and their sequences so for this assignment it also took me quite a long time figure out but eventually after watching several tutorials slowy started to understand how the breadboard connects and what certain type of odes do.</p>
