        <h2><b>Website Development</b></h2>
        <p>For my first website we were told to watch a video by Jake Wright explaining how to make a basic webpage and based on what I learned from the video as you can see below in the image although it looks very simple I actually had a pretty hard time following along since it was first my time creating a website so along the way I think Mr Rodney sort of knew the whole class were having a hard time starting out so he gave us a starting point by explaining and showing us how to properly start a html doc and intoducing some shortcut tools and also at the same time told us to start slow and learn from basics first which after a few attempts and multiple times of rewatching Jake Wright's videos and copying and pasting of w3 schools I finally created my website.</p>

        <a href="web_dev02.jpg"></a><img src="images/web_dev02.jpg" width="400px" /></a>
        <p>After a few days because I got more interested I then decided to develop it some more by changing the arrangement of the navigations and choosing a better color scheme and during the course of journey in my creation of this website I had to use w3 schools many times and search through youtube videos as I had never learnt coding before so for one example the organisation of my website It actually took me a long time to figure out how to delete empty spacings and white spacings to give it a cleancut look so how I figured was through a video where they included this solution code other than that I also added a background image in the back to make my website look nicer created a new container so i can separate my contents and footer into one section and header and tabs into a different Section .</p>

        <h2><b>Computer Aided Design GIMP</b></h2>
        <p>In this lesson I was tasked to mix a mixture of two images using GIMP and because I am a student came from MAD School I found it quite fun as it reminded me of using photoshop although the tools are a little different so basically for this task I started out by dragging and dropping he image into the file and then used the free transform tool to outline the cat and subsequently deleting the original background and added a new background in the back and save them as jpeg and png</p>

        <h2><b>Computer Aided Design Inkscape</b></h2>
        <p>In this lesson we were tasked to create a vector image by using a software called Inkscape so for this tasked how I did it was by dragging and dropping the image into the software and next I had to use the path tool and fill and stroke to generate out shapes by using the pent tool to drag the curve to the specfic curvature and continously until you end it and click on fill path to genrate the shape and after multiple times of doing the same thing again it will then be completed</p>

        <h2><b>Computer Aided Design Fusion 360</b></h2>
        <p>In this lesson we were tasked to create 7 models which included, a lego brick, a keychain, a clock shape, a cup, a staircase boxes, a hex nut, a wrench and a Knight's chess piece</p>
        <p>so basically for each of them I started out with a top down view and sketch them out in fusion 360 and used tools the line tool, dimension tool and etc to draw out the specific shape and subsequently I then use the extrusion tool and the revovle tool to generate the shape out but if you want to go into a more detailed explanation you can read more below.</p>
